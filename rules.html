            <p> <strong>RULES OF PLAY & POLICIES</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>SPORTSMANSHIP</strong>
                    <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice
                        the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator,
                        administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
                        disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
                        accomplishments or standing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>DIMENSIONS</strong>: IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                            within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to
                            for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>COMPETITION FIELDS</strong>: Fields used within the competition program must be a
                            minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state
                            competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements
                            must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect
                            the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions
                            should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide
                            an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                        <li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields for
                                    older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>
                                <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
                                <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
                                <li>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal dimensions and
                                    size of goal similarly modified.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ALL-PLAY</strong>
                    <p>All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play at least fifty percent of
                        each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of each
                        game.</p>
                    <p>A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game under special circumstances,
                        e.g., unexcused absences from practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or
                        games, and injuries.</p>
